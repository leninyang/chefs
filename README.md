# ChefsCorner

Heroku link: https://fast-refuge-65928.herokuapp.com/

Technology Used: HTML, CSS (Materialize), EJS, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express, Node.js

Approach Taken: ChefsCorner is a full-stack two model CRUD application built using an MVC structure. The application works like a web-based Instragram where you share a picture with a description.

Other features I would have liked to implement but did not get too would be a "like" feature for each post and a "comment" section.
